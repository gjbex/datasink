Whereas [`vacuum_sink`](vacuum_sink.md) converts a sink file to a single, aggregated data file, `split_sink` converts a sink file to as many files as there where sinks that contributed to the file.  Each resulting file will contain only the data generated by a sigle process.

Executing
```
split_sink  -sink_file data.sink  -out_file_base out.txt
```
would result in `nr_sink` files named `out.txt.0000`, `out.txt.0001`, ..., that each contain the data written by process `0`, `1`, ..., respectively.

Optionally, `split_sink` can produce feedback useful for tuning and/or debugging.  The `-verbose` flag allows to set the level of information printed to standard error.  For level 0 there is no feedback, level ` provides run time information, higher levels may be added in future.
